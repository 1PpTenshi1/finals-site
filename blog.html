                            The web development landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace. As developers, 
                            we're witnessing a paradigm shift that's redefining how we build, deploy, and 
                            maintain web applications. From the rise of AI-powered development tools to the 
                            growing adoption of serverless architectures, the industry is embracing innovations 
                            that promise to make development more efficient and applications more powerful.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Key Trends to Watch</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>AI-Assisted Development:</strong> Tools like GitHub Copilot are revolutionizing 
                            how we write code, making developers more productive than ever before.</li>
                            <li><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> Moving computation closer to users for faster, 
                            more responsive applications.</li>
                            <li><strong>WebAssembly:</strong> Enabling high-performance applications that run 
                            at near-native speeds in the browser.</li>
                            <li><strong>Micro-frontends:</strong> Breaking down monolithic frontend applications 
                            into manageable, independent pieces.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>
                            As we look ahead, it's clear that adaptability and continuous learning will be 
                            crucial for success in this rapidly changing field. The developers who thrive 
                            will be those who embrace these new technologies while maintaining a solid 
                            foundation in core web development principles.

                    <p class="blog-excerpt">
                        Reflecting on my experiences, challenges, and growth throughout my computer science 
                        education at Central Philippine University.

                        <p>
                            Starting my journey as a Computer Science student at Central Philippine University 
                            has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. When I first entered the program, 
                            I had basic knowledge of programming but little understanding of the vast world of 
                            computer science that lay ahead.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>The Learning Curve</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first year was intense. Learning multiple programming languages simultaneously 
                            while grasping fundamental concepts like data structures and algorithms felt 
                            overwhelming at times. However, each challenge became a stepping stone that built 
                            my confidence and problem-solving abilities.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Key Milestones</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mastering my first programming language (Python)</li>
                            <li>Building my first web application</li>
                            <li>Contributing to open-source projects</li>
                            <li>Landing my first internship</li>
                            <li>Developing a full-stack application for my thesis</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>
                            Looking back, I'm grateful for every late night spent debugging code, every 
                            challenging project that pushed my limits, and every professor who encouraged 
                            me to think beyond the textbook. This journey has not only taught me technical 
                            skills but also valuable life lessons about perseverance, collaboration, and 
                            continuous learning.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            To fellow students just starting their CS journey: embrace the challenges, 
                            don't be afraid to ask questions, and remember that every expert was once 
                            a beginner. The field of computer science is vast and exciting, with endless 
                            opportunities to create, innovate, and make a positive impact on the world.
